            <p>I conducted research into contemporary design trends and portfolio websites within my industry. This included analyzing competitor portfolios and seeking inspiration from design communities and online resources.
              I collected examples of layouts, color schemes, and interactive elements that resonated with my vision for the new portfolio.</p>

             <p>As I embarked on the journey to design my portfolio, I began by creating a mood board. I searched the web and design resources to gather a wide variety of visual elements that resonated with my vision for the portfolio. I carefully selected a collection of elements that sparked my creativity.

              The mood board proved to be a very effective tool that helped determine what my final vision of the portfolio webpage. </p>

            <p>My style guide served as a template where I displayed all of my design choices for my portfolio.

              Typography was a critical consideration for my portfolio's development. I delved into various font styles and combinations, evaluating how each one complemented the overall aesthetic. The mood board helped me make informed decisions about typography.</p>

            <p>When wire framing my portfolio design I began by creating a basic outline of what I wanted it to look like. After receiving feedback from my peers it was clear to me that my design was missing a few components. 

              The above photo on the right show the changes in design that were implemented after receiving iterative feedback. I added a navigation component so that users can easily find their way around my portfolio instead of having to scroll through the whole thing to see it. I also redesigned the layout of the information according to some criticism I received about the initial design being too messy. I added more photo elements to represent the skills I am showcasing. I also added a grid-style display for the “My Work” section to have it all be visible in one section instead of two like in the initial design. Lastly, I included a footer element which navigates users to all of the section from the bottom of the webpage as well. </p>

        <p>The final design of my portfolio webpage is the result of an iterative and collaborative process that truly reflects the valuable insights gained through feedback and the collective vision of both myself and my peers. I recognized the importance of continually seeking input and making refinements along the way. Through constructive feedback sessions with peers, I was able to fine-tune the user experience, ensuring that the portfolio not only met my personal goals but also resonated with a broader audience. Every element on the webpage was carefully considered and implemented to showcase what both myself and my peers deemed valuable in representing my skills, achievements, and professional journey. </p>
